<h2>INTENSIVE TRAINING OF UNSKILLED WORKERS AS A
MEANS OF OVERCOMING LABOR SHORTAGE</h2>

<p>The Committee on Labor, Advisory Commission of the Council
of National Defense, of which Samuel Gompers is chairman, authorizes
the following from the Official Bulletin of August 14:</p>

<p>The grave situation of shortage of labor (it now being estimated
that there is a shortage of 250,000 skilled workers<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>) is being met
by a new quick method of training operatives. All over the country,
day by day, one factory after another falls into line and puts in a
training department to train its own people—the same sort of quick,
intensive-training plan to meet the same sort of situation which the
regulations in France prescribe for every manufacturer employing
300 people or more, and the English ministry of munitions requires
in its contracts for materials. And the situation must be met in
greater degree and substantially all factories must train their workers
if the 750,000 new skilled workers which the country needs by
January 1 are skilled and efficient and standing at their job by
that time.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Note: September 30, now estimated 500,000.</p>

</div>
</div>


<h3>PROVED BY THE FACTORIES</h3>

<p>To-day 100<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> important factories making war orders are proving
that it is possible to train their own men. They do not assume to
teach a worker a whole trade in the brief time available. They do
teach him by the methods of the training department how to master
one process or one machine in a few weeks or a few days. These
100 factories are spending, or preparing to spend, at the rate of
$1,500,000 solely in this business of intensive training of new
workers. This training investment is not an expense, as the training
is immediately upon production and the product from the
training room is expected to equal that in the factory. All the
training departments mentioned are on a production basis at all
times, with speed and accuracy as the watchword.</p>

<h3>DECLARATION OF POLICY</h3>

<p>One year ago that section of the committee on labor of the Council
of National Defense which has been instrumental in developing
the training department or vestibule schools above noted recorded
the following as its declaration of policy:</p>

<p>“The Section on Industrial Training for the War Emergency
is concerned with industrial training only as a war measure. It is
not concerned with vocational education in general. In all cases in
the existing crisis shortage of labor must be met first by training
operatives from allied trades who are unemployed and by advancing
operatives of ability from lower to higher positions in the occupation
itself. For instance, apprentices should be advanced rather
than outsiders. It is possible that many sewing women will be
without work, and many men in the building trades. For all such,
new and fitting places must be developed where possible. Non-wage
earners must not be trained to take places for which unemployed
wage earners may reasonably be trained.”</p>

<p>At the same time the section on industrial training stated the
following to be its plan and scope:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>
<p>1. Increased use of the public vocational schools through the
co-operation of local manufacturers. This is being done very fortunately
in Worcester, Bridgeport and some other cities.</p>

<p>2. Introduce new workers, men and women, into industry
through these schools.</p>

<p>3. Arrange for the training of present mechanics and others
in existing workrooms in connection with regular production, and by
more scientific procedure than heretofore.</p>

<p>4. As of particular importance, act as a clearing house, that
the judgment and experience, good and bad, in each locality may
be available to all.</p>

<p>The section on industrial training, a part of the welfare division
of the committee on labor, is composed of one-third representatives
of labor, one-third employers and one-third experts in factory training.
State committees similarly organized have been developed where
war products are being made. There are at present nine associate
branch committees of the section on industrial training, which are
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New England, New Jersey, New York,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>


<h3>KEEPING CHECK ON TRAINING</h3>

<p>The section recommends three checks on the factory training
department, to be made daily by report:</p>

<p>1. How many operatives are sent into the factory? (If this
were the only test they might be sent in too fast and only partly
trained.)</p>

<p>2. Cost, net, after crediting production which should equal the
shop average.</p>

<p>3. Wastage.—There should be none. There should be 100
per cent. Government inspection.</p>

<p>These training departments, because of the thorough training
given, have yielded from 10 to 40 per cent. increase in production,
both for men and women, and the labor turnover has been reduced
materially thereby.</p>

<p>Great care has been taken to advocate that unemployed men be
adapted and trained in new trades for the period of the war and
that unskilled men be educated wherever possible before resorting
to the employment of women.</p>


<h3>POSSIBILITIES OF DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p>As an indication of the possibilities of this development, the
experience of the State of New Jersey co-operating with this section
may be cited. In order to overcome possible objection which labor
might have to the introduction of emergency training a program
was agreed on, after a series of conferences, which was heartily
approved by all the employers and by the representatives of the
employees. Some of the clauses of this agreement are as follows:</p>

<p>“All skilled labor available within the surrounding territory
should be brought into the essential war industries before it is
unduly diluted by the introduction of unskilled labor. When such
dilution is necessary, and in the opinion of the committee that time
has already arrived, the more skilled activities should be supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
by training those already at work and successful in handling the
lesser skilled activities of the same general type. The lesser skilled
activities should be supplied by training those already skilled in
non-essential activities and not engaged at present in essential war
industries, and who, because of such skill, are peculiarly capable of
quickly learning the rudiments of the new activities.</p>

<p>“Exploitation of labor and reduction of wages through dilution
for war purposes is to be avoided, and to this end persons brought
into an essential industry, or promoted from one grade of work to
another, are to be paid the prevailing rate of wages for the class
of work for which they have been trained, after a training period
of reasonable duration.</p>

<p>“Dilution of labor by the employment of women when necessary
is recommended, provided women receive wages equal to men for
the class of work performed by them, and provided the working
conditions surrounding their activities are carefully controlled for
their comfort and well-being.”</p>


<h3>ELIMINATING HOUSING PROBLEM</h3>

<p>One interesting result of training resident unemployed is the
practical elimination of the housing problem in certain instances.</p>

<p>This is exemplified in the city of Detroit, where it is estimated
that 50,000 additional mechanics will be needed before the end of the
year. If those now engaged in the war plants could be advanced
to more skilled positions, and their places be filled by present residents
of Detroit engaged in non-essential or unskilled industries, or
those not now at work, the need for housing of the 50,000 mechanics
with their families could be, if not entirely, at least, in part,
eliminated.</p>

<p>All who have tried these intensive methods of training are
happily surprised at the shortness of time required to make skilled
operatives for precision work in tool room and factory of men from
non-essential trades and of the more intelligent women now entering
industry for the war.</p>


<h3>ACTIVITIES OF THE CHAIRMAN</h3>

<p>To stimulate effort and arouse interest in training the idle and
potential workers in each community, as well as to facilitate the up-grading
of the old operatives, the sectional chairman has traveled
from one manufacturing center to another for the past 12 months,
addressing leading metal, machine-tool, and other manufacturers’
associations. He has also actually assisted in the establishment of
vestibule Training Departments in the plants.</p>

<p>Both single shops and great industrial communities are acting
upon the advice of this section, which will furnish experts for
investigation and planning upon request.</p>

<h2>PRATT INSTITUTE’S NATIONAL SERVICE COURSES IN
MACHINE WORK</h2>

<p>As a contribution to industrial training for the war emergency,
Pratt Institute is conducting day and evening courses in Machine
Work, which have been especially organized to serve the present need
for increased productive efficiency in this country’s machine shops.
These courses are designed to aid ambitious machine shop workers
of limited development, including machine operators, bench hands
and machinists’ helpers, who wish to extend and broaden their
practical ability as a means to personal advancement in the trade,
increased earning power and fuller service to production. Pratt
Institute’s Machine Shop has been continuously employed to maximum
capacity for this instruction since the entry of the United
States into the war.</p>

<p>The Machine Work comprises six graded courses, each of which
requires for its completion six weeks, if taken as a full-time day
course, seven hours per day, or if taken as an evening course, twenty-four
weeks, three evenings per week, two hours per evening. Day
students register and pay tuition for six weeks, and evening students
for twelve weeks. New classes are started at frequent intervals.
A student may start in any course for which he is qualified,
and may enroll for additional courses, either consecutively, or at
some later time, if he finds it desirable to withdraw temporarily.
Students are permitted also to transfer at any time from the day
to the evening course or vice versa, with full credit for work
already performed.</p>

<p>The instruction is adapted to the individual. Men capable of
following directions without excessive damage to material or equipment
are put on productive work. Men who have not reached this
degree of efficiency are commonly assigned exercises. About 75
per cent. of the work is productive. Production is introduced as a
means to greater efficiency in training.</p>

<p>Courses in Wooden Boat and Shipbuilding, Marine Engineering,
Gasoline Engine Maintenance and Operation, Machine Drawing and
Design, Ship Drafting, Chemical Laboratory Practice, in addition
to an extensive list of day and evening trade and technical courses,
all of which are of special service in the war emergency, are being
conducted.</p>

<h2>BOARDMAN TRADE SCHOOL</h2>

<p>The Boardman Apprentice Shop, under which name New
Haven, Conn., operates a Trade School, is doing its share toward
meeting the shortage of skilled and semi-skilled help and plans are
being made to further this work.</p>

<p>The “Shop” teaches many trades under actual trade conditions,
but as the most pressing need is for machine workers this trade
only will be considered in this article even to the exclusion of the
drafting department, second in importance, and results to the
machine department.</p>

<p>Primarily this Trade School is operated to teach boys, but the
evening continuation classes have grown in importance year by
year until they have reached the present high standard of efficiency.</p>

<p>The machine department trains fifty boys in the day course
and under normal conditions the boy graduates after 4,800 hours
of study, seventy-five per cent. being trade practice and twenty-five
per cent. academic study. At present many boys leave before the
completion of their course to enter local munition factories. These
boys are in great demand and even after a few months of training
are found extremely useful in those factories.</p>

<p>The boys who complete their studies and receive their diplomas
are largely sought for tool room work.</p>

<p>Thus the school is supplying more trained hands than the number
of boys and length of course would indicate and that is but part
of the story. These boys work eight hours a day, forty-four hours
a week, fifty weeks a year, and produce real machinery practically
all of which goes into the munition plants.</p>

<p>One lot of forty-five Horizontal Tappers was built and boxed
and ready for shipment to Glasgow for use on British munitions
long before cargo space was available.</p>

<p>The boys build two sizes of screw slotting machines, two sizes of
horizontal tapping machines, lathes, slide rests, drill press vises and
hundreds of small cutters.</p>

<p>They have built and shipped about six hundred machines, not
including slide rests and vises.</p>

<p>The screw slotters and tapping machines are of a type in great
demand for munition factories, being particularly serviceable for
use on fuse parts, small arms and government hardware.</p>

<p>Thus, the school, while following its basic plan, is supplying
the country’s vital needs in training boys and at the same time
making an essential product.</p>

<p>In addition, further use of the equipment is secured by the
operation of night continuation classes for twenty-five weeks in the
year. The classes are operated six nights per week and Saturday
afternoon with instructors taken from the local factories under one
of the regular day force.</p>

<p>Men in all stages of experience, ambitious apprentices, unskilled
clerks, drivers, porters, etc., who wish to enter the local munition
factories come to these classes.</p>

<p>As an instance of extremes we may take the case of a painter
of sixty who entered the Marlin Rockwell Corporation on machine
work after two seasons of study; and the case of an experienced
toolmaker taking advantage of the equipment to learn some new
operations so as to fit himself for a higher grade of work. Both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
men made good. Machinists take the continuation course so that
they may qualify as toolmakers. Four classes of fifty men—making
a total of two hundred men—are taught in the night classes.</p>

<p>The results have been so satisfactory that these classes will be
continued and if the demand warrants women will be given instruction
upon specified evenings. The school management believes that
the day is coming when women will receive a far greater share
of trade instruction.</p>

<p>Plans are in operation to increase the efficiency of the school
by teaching special classes. For instance, a class in the use of
measuring instruments and gauges would prove valuable and reduce,
in a great measure, the time taken in training the unskilled men
and women taking up factory work. Large numbers can be handled
in such courses.</p>

<p>The school is prepared to take crippled and disabled resident
soldiers in any of its trade courses, night or day, when the demand
comes.</p>

<p>Since this article was prepared, orders for fifty No. 1 screw
slotters and twelve No. 1 vertical tapping machines have been
booked at this school.</p>

<p>This order of twelve tapping machines will go directly into an
optical factory for use on government supplies.</p>

<h2>DAYTON INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTE</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Dayton, Ohio</p>

<p>The Dayton Industrial Institute was established to replace
the vestibule schools in the following plants: The Dayton Engineering
Laboratories Co., the Domestic Engineering Co., the Dayton
Metal Products Co., and the Dayton Wright Airplane Co.</p>

<p>Although the school has been fostered by the above companies,
any manufacturer in Dayton is at liberty to send students to the
school under certain regulations.</p>

<p>The Directors of the several companies thought it advisable to
segregate the training school from the plants, and combine the
school under one directing head. Most gratifying results have been
obtained since the opening of the school January 1, 1918.</p>

<p>During the past seven months over 500 persons, from all walks
of life, have been trained for factory work. About 200 of this
number were women.</p>

<p>In addition to the large number of people trained, over 100,000
pieces of commercial product have been manufactured, which passed
the most rigid factory inspection.</p>

<p>A large percentage of the work has been parts of war products,
such as detonator bodies, Liberty motor ignition parts, inspection
gauges for war materials, crank shafts, cam shafts, motor truck parts,
etc., as well as airplane parts, consisting of ribs, fins, stabilizers,
wheel covers, etc., for the DeHaviland fighting plane.</p>

<p>Would it not be advisable for manufacturers in some communities,
and especially for small manufacturers, to pool their interests
in regard to industrial training, in order that the schools may
be a peace time asset, as well as to satisfy a war time emergency?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>


<h2>WRIGHT-MARTIN AIRCRAFT CORPORATION</h2>

<p>The Wright-Martin Aircraft Corporation has two shop training
departments, one at the Long Island City plant and the other at
the plant in New Brunswick, N. J. Both plants are engaged in the
manufacture of a high-grade aeroplane engine.</p>

<p>Each training department occupies about 10,000 square feet of
floor space in buildings separate from the factories. They are
equipped with modern machinery tooled up for production, the
machines and equipment being of the same type as that in the
factory proper.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of these departments is to train women,
also men, for the needs of the factory, upon production work,
assembly, inspection, shop clerk work and tool crib tending. It is
the aim of the Instruction Department to train the learner to do
her work habitually correct, both as to quantity and quality. With
this in mind the training rooms are miniature factories equipped
with lathes, automatic screw machines, hand screw machines, J. &amp; L.
Turret Lathes, hand millers, plain millers, sensitive drills, upright
drills, radial drills, plain grinders, internal grinders and bench
equipment. Jigs and fixtures and the operation tool equipment
necessary for the production work are used on these machines, that
those being trained may become entirely familiar with the tools
they are required to handle when they go into the shop. The
machines and the operation tool equipment were selected after the
complete layout of the main operations had been carefully gone
over and the operations that women could perform were listed.</p>

<p>Considerable care has been used in selecting the learners and
the class of women under training are of good type. A number of
these have worked in shops before; others have been in offices. Our
experience has been that our most successful women are those who
have had to work for their living, either in shops or offices, up to
the time they entered our employ. The range of ages preferred
varies from 21 to 35. The first few hundred women selected were
about 35 years of age, the maturity and judgment going with such
an age being of value in stabilizing later conditions when hundreds
more, of a more general sort, will be employed. Many of the
women are mothers, wives, or relatives of those at the front.</p>

<p>The training is given upon actual factory production in the
manufacture of parts that enter into the construction of the motor.
Such manufacturing furnishes an excellent medium for instruction
in the various branches above mentioned, and holds both the learner
and the instructor up to the factory requirements. The standards
of the factory are the standards of the training department both as
to quantity and quality. Work is routed to the Instruction Department
according to the regular shop forms and the finished product
is transferred from the Instruction Department in the same manner
as work is transferred within the factory, the Instruction Department
receiving credit for what it does.</p>

<p>So far, women are being trained at a rate equal to the demands
of the factory, which is fast approaching 120 per week, this being
the approximate weekly training capacity of the training department.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
In some branches of work it takes four days to train, in
others ten days, the length of time varying according to the time it
takes the learner to reach the average hourly production.</p>

<p>Records of production, while under training, are plotted on
cross section paper and when the learner has reached the average
hourly production she is declared trained in that particular line.
In some cases women after two or three days’ training have done
25 per cent. higher than the average hourly production stated for
the job. Records of salvage are also kept as a check on such
training, and every effort is made to combine a steep production
curve and a minimum salvage curve with good training. The
salvage records of the learners are remarkably low, some weeks
averaging much less than 1 per cent., the highest being less than
that in the factory itself.</p>

<p>After the women have been transferred to the factory their
progress is kept track of for at least one week, to make sure that
they are following the instructions given in the training room.
Those who do not make good after training are assigned back to
the training room for further instruction, or for such disposition
as the chief instructor may see fit.</p>

<p>Regularly, during the week, the learners are given general
lectures, talks and instructions on matters that relate to their training,
that they may be more generally fitted for the line of work
into which they are to be transferred.</p>

<p>The results obtained have been very interesting. The women
are very enthusiastic and the foremen are highly pleased. In one
branch the foreman advised, when asked how things were going:
“You can give me thirty more women right away; they are all
right,” In another branch a foreman advised that he would not
exchange a good share of the women in his department for an equal
number of the best men he had on his floor.</p>

<p>The instruction in each training room is given by four male
instructors, with women assistants; the women assistants having
been selected from the best of those who have been trained within
the department. The men instructors are all first class mechanics,
especially capable on production work and teaching.</p>

<p>The instructors are regularly interviewed from time to time,
and the work they are doing is carefully reviewed, with the purpose
of building them up as efficient instructors.</p>

<p>As a part of the training program at New Brunswick an
evening school is conducted for the men in the company’s employ.
The instruction work given consists of technical studies related
to the mechanical trades, and includes blue-print reading, shop
drawing, shop mathematics and clerical work in its different
branches. This is used in conjunction with a promotion program,
whereby men who are capable are promoted into various openings
as they occur, requiring more skill of the same sort they already
have.</p>

<h2>WINCHESTER REPEATING ARMS COMPANY</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">New Haven, Conn.</p>

<p>Manifestly, all large employers of labor must train their help
to a greater or less degree. It has always been the practice of the
Winchester Company to do a great deal of this training, but until
the past few years it had all been done in the shops or office where
the candidate was to work. For many years it has been the practice
to take intelligent boys and young men in the office with the idea
of continually promoting them to more responsible positions after
they became competent and the positions developed where they
might be used. Our graduate apprentices, adjusters and tool
setters have been so well trained that they have always been sought
for by competitive concerns. Since the war, and especially during
the past six or eight months, it has become increasingly necessary
to develop the training of employees to the greatest extent. Where
formerly help might be obtained who had, at least, some knowledge
of machines and shop practice, <em>it is now necessary to take help
who have absolutely no knowledge of factory work and teach them
to become skilled</em>. In addition, <em>this must be done in the least possible
time</em>.</p>

<p>To take care of this condition, we have developed in addition
to our regular apprentice course, a training course for administrative
and executive positions, an Office School, a Gun Department
Adjuster’s Shop, a Cartridge Department Training Shop and Tool
Department Training Shop.</p>

<p>The regular apprentice course is designed to give complete
training for machinists, gauge makers, tool and fixture makers, etc.
The course which ordinarily requires three years to complete has
recently been shortened so that some of the boys are graduated in
two years. It is the desire to give thorough instruction in the
practical work mentioned above. The average enrollment is approximately
90.</p>

<p>The training course for administrative and executive positions
is designed to cover briefly such shop and office practice as will give
the broadest general knowledge that is likely to be required of those
in the more important positions in the administrative organization.
This class consists of only about a dozen men who are picked with
all possible care.</p>


<h3>OFFICE SCHOOL</h3>

<p>The Office School under competent instructors consists of a group
of clerks who do the complete work of making up pay roll, labor
distribution cards, etc., for a number of factory shops which were
chosen because of their having respective classes of work. Prospective
clerks are taken into this school, trained on pay roll work,
transferred to the Central Pay Roll Division as help is needed.
In addition to this school for pay roll clerks, model shop offices are
being established in each of the major departments where correct
methods will be carefully taught. It is our aim to have all shop
clerks pass through one of these model shop offices to receive their
training, as this will insure standard methods and proper following
of procedures. These model shop offices will also act as reservoirs
on which to draw to supply vacancies caused by absences among
the regular shop office staff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>


<h3>GUN DEPARTMENT ADJUSTER’S SHOP</h3>

<p>The shop for training adjusters for the Gun Department is
designed to teach men how to adjust the type of machines to which
they are to be assigned for all classes of work which may be run
upon them. This training should ordinarily take <em>from two to four</em>
weeks, but many times it has seemed desirable to graduate candidates
more quickly than this; if they are bright and intelligent it has
proven satisfactory to do so. No attempt has been made to train
operators in the Gun Department except in the shops where they
are to work. Most of this work can be learned in a <em>very few</em> days
under the instruction of a well trained adjuster.</p>


<h3>CARTRIDGE TRAINING SHOP</h3>

<p>The Cartridge Training Shop was designed to train adjusters
and tool setters, and some operators. Due to the great number of
new employees, it has been impossible to have all tool setters and
adjusters pass through this school, but it is hoped that in the near
future we may be able to train an increasing percentage of them
here. Such men as have received this training have shown beyond
doubt that they have been much benefited by it, and that it is most
desirable to expand it to include as many of this class of workmen
as possible. Some operators have been trained in the Cartridge
Training School with excellent results, but most of the work is relatively
simple and the training has been satisfactorily done in the
shop to which the new employees have been assigned.</p>


<h3>TOOL DEPARTMENT TRAINING SHOP</h3>

<p>A new Tool Department Training Shop is just being started for
the purpose of training operators on lathes, milling machines, planers,
grinders, etc. At first we tried to train this kind of help in the
Apprentice Shop, but because of the fact that the kind of instruction
was so vastly different, it has been decided impractical. In the
one case, we wish to give very complete, broad instructions, and in
the other, the desire is to train for one kind of work only in the
least possible time.</p>


<h3>MANUFACTURING TOOL SHOPS</h3>

<p>We have two shops working night and day offering facilities for
the training of unskilled people in certain lines of tool work. These
people are taken in totally without experience, and placed under the
tutelage of our best mechanics, and trained quickly as specialists.
Within a remarkably short time they are capable of producing all
sorts of tools used in the production of guns and ammunition, thus
relieving the general tool shop of a great volume of work which
would otherwise require the services of skilled tool makers. From
the forces in these shops we are able to recruit the more advanced
men for gauge, jig and fixture work. We consider these shops one
of the best examples possible of training upon a productive basis.</p>

<p>Aside from the regular training courses as outlined, there are
many instructors throughout the shops whose duty it is to explain
the best ways of doing the various tasks to which employees are
assigned. It has been our intent throughout, in choosing instructors,
to select those who are real teachers, having the necessary patience
and human understanding required to successfully do work of this
kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>The regular source through which we train toolmakers is the
Apprentice Shop. This shop has an enrollment of 125 boys, who are
trained in a three-year course to become expert all-round mechanics.</p>

<p>In addition to this, two of our largest shops, of 250 men each,
have during the past year and a half conducted special training
courses for green men on the more elementary work of toolmaking.
The purpose of these courses is to train men who have had no
mechanical experience to the point where they can be used to free
more expert men from all routine and simple work. These men
are started on a lathe grinder or milling machine. Those men
who show special aptitude are taught how to use two or more
machines, while the rest are trained to operate only a single type.
<em>By means of our special course of instruction it is possible to train
new men in a period of a week to four weeks</em>, depending on the
man and on the kind of work for which he is being trained. During
the last year and a half over 500 men have been trained in this
way. Recently 60 men were trained in one month. The best of
these are advanced to more difficult work, and some of them even
become third class toolmakers.</p>

<p>In addition to this work, we have been training girls since last
March to do machine work. These girls have hitherto been sent
directly to the Apprentice Shop and there given a week’s training
on a lathe or a milling machine on repetition work. After this
they were transferred to one of the regular shops where they have
done extremely good work.</p>

<p>In addition to the training of expert toolmakers and mechanics
for the Tool Department, we are also training mechanics for the Gun
and Cartridge Departments. Each of these departments has a school
or training department containing representative machines and in
these schools men are given a course of instruction lasting from one
to two months. This prepares them to go out into the shops and
take care of a group of machines, keeping them in repair, supplied
with proper tools, and generally in good running order.</p>

<p>Third, since the above was still not sufficient to fill our requirements,
it was decided to start a regular training shop in which to
train machinists and toolmakers, as well as gauge-makers. These men
were to be trained in the use of three or four machines; the lathe,
miller, planer, shaper and grinder. They were to do the more simple
work on these machines, but still, work that was not repetition. In
just three weeks after the plan had been accepted, the space was
secured, and the equipment of 30 machines, tools, and everything
which goes with a complete shop, including overhead shafting, was
installed. Moreover, a complete set of drawings representing 40
typical operations was made and blue-printed, and these will serve
as a plan of instruction. On Monday morning, three weeks after the
plan was approved, the shop, with a complete personnel of foremen
and instructors, began operation. <em>It is planned to turn men out in
from three to five weeks.</em></p>

<p>In all our work the emphasis is on production. Training wherever
possible is given on actual production work. This not only makes
possible training of a very practical nature, but also helps to lessen
the cost of the instruction.</p>

<h2>BROWN &amp; SHARPE MANUFACTURING COMPANY</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Providence, R. I.</p>

<p>In our own experience, without doubt, much more attention
has been given by foremen and fellow-workmen to the supervision
of women’s work than has been given to the average male employee
in the past, the assumption being that a woman, having less mechanical
background and intuition than a man, required more
training and more specific instructions. This has been the reason
advanced by some foremen in explaining why women were doing
better work and had “broken in” more quickly than men, and
they have added, “If we had given the same kind of attention to
each new man employed, he would have done just as well as the
girl”; this is, after all, an admission on the part of the foreman
that he had not in the past helped all he could, and an indirect
compliment to the girl having much significance. It may be noted,
however, that at the time when such comparisons were made the
average man who could be secured was of an unsatisfactory and
irresponsible class, as so few trained or competent men were available
for positions in the industries, while, on the other hand, in
hiring girls a selection from a large number of applicants could
be made, so that it was possible to obtain a much better average
having the qualities to make successful workers.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that there are advantages in having both
men and women in the same department, as it tends to hold the
same standard of workmanship and speed for women as for men,
while it is believed that having a separate department for women
may establish a separate and lower standard, the tendency being
to make more allowance for women because of sex. The results
seem to show that it is not at all necessary that separate standards
should be established and that in some lines of work even more can
be expected of women than of men because of their nimble fingers
and quickness of motion. As to questions of discipline, where the
two sexes are employed in the same work-room, little or no difficulty
is experienced under capable foremanship.</p>

<p>Actual results have proved that the fears in the minds of some
that there would be opposition on the part of foremen and workmen
to the employment of women in the shop were ungrounded. A foreman
remarked to a visitor: “See that girl working beside the
man assembling speed indicators? She is working with him so as
to learn all the requirements, and he knows that she is to have his
job as soon as she has become sufficiently proficient, but he is
helping her in every way possible. Of course, we shall find other
work for the man; and often, with the present shortage of help,
such a change of work can be in the line of promotion.” This illustrates
the spirit which is practically universal throughout the shop,
and which has been an important factor in bringing about the
success of the plan.</p>

<p>While the money question—the earning power—is uppermost
in the minds of the majority, many of the women show also a distinct
ambition to equal or excel men in the work they do. Soon
after the employment of women was begun in the gear department,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
a girl who was cutting sprockets on a gear-cutting machine became
discouraged and said she was afraid she could not make a success
of the job. Her foreman was surprised and said to her, “We have
not made any complaint as to your work, have we?” “No,” she
said, “but the man who worked on the night job turned out 105
pieces, while the best I could do was only 85 pieces a day.” Her
foreman asked if she realized that the man on the night force was
working three hours more per day than she was, and after learning
this she felt less discouraged with the results she had obtained.</p>

<p>In the gear department where a number of girls have been
“broken in” in operating gear-cutting machines, the foreman
said that they had taken hold as quickly as the average man,
and some of them are doing exceptionally good and intelligent
work. This has partly resulted from the girls being thrown as
rapidly as possible on their own resources, being taught to set up
their machines, working from a blue-print, to measure their work,
and do everything that had previously been required of the operator.
A criticism has recently been made of some of the departments to the
effect that the foremen were giving so much supervision to the
women’s work that they were not thrown sufficiently on their own
resources, and thus were not trained to be responsible for the work
in hand. This again speaks well for the women, as showing that
there is a growing appreciation of their ability to do more advanced
work than had at first been expected.</p>

<p>In inspection work a field has been found for women in which
they are making an exceptionally good showing. The chief inspector
was asked whether women were learning to read the micrometer
caliper. He replied that they learned to read it and read it accurately,
in a very short time, and that the work passing through
their hands showed much discrimination as to the points criticised.
He pointed to a pile of work rejected by one of the women inspectors
and said, “I have just had a man go over this work, and he has
found that while the work failed to pass inspection for many reasons,
they were all good reasons.” He said further that in inspecting
grinding work he was surprised at the quickness with which
some of his women inspectors would pick out batches of work identifying
them as coming from particular workmen whose work was
known to be above the average. In another department, in inspecting
measuring tools, a similar condition was noted by the foreman, and
he stated that one of the girl inspectors recently told him that she
liked to inspect the work of Mr. Blank, because it required so few
rejections. “And,” remarked the foreman, “she sized the situation
up just right.” He also showed the writer the notes attached to
a number of tools which had been held out by the woman inspector
for corrections, these criticisms showing much discrimination on her
part, and as good a degree of judgment as would have been expected
from the experienced inspectors who had previously been doing the
work. It is thus found that in the class of inspection work where
women are employed the standard is not lowered because of their
employment.</p>

<p>Already several women are employed in the toolmaking department.
One of these employees, who was operating a lathe turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
out tool-steel blanks for bits and reamers, doing her own setting
up and measuring, evinced enthusiasm for machine shop work, showing,
in reply to questions, that her work was opening up a new
field in which she took especial interest and she remarked, “No
more housework for me,” with such feeling that it was evident her
interests strongly leaned in a mechanical direction. Girls in the
toolmaking department are working on universal milling machines,
surface grinders, etc., as well as lathes. Some of the younger girls
throughout the works are employed as messengers.</p>

<h2>TOOLROOM ANALYSIS</h2>

<p>What does tool room work consist of? It can be separated into
two divisions, namely, that which only the skilled toolmaker can do,
such as laying out, fitting, assembling and devising special setups.
The balance is machine work. Let us consider the latter and see
what it consists of.</p>

<p><em>Machines.</em> The machines used are generally the engine lathe, the
horizontal and vertical millers, planers, shaper, plain, flat and universal
grinders, drill press and filing machines. Hobbing and
bench lathes may be added.</p>

<p><em>The Lathe.</em> The lathe work usually consists in machining work
preparatory to hardening and grinding. This may be roughly
divided into turning, chucking and faceplate work. The toolmaker
frequently does all of this work. Let us relieve him of this work
and use our semi-skilled man to do it for him. Let one man do the
turning, another the chucking and another the faceplate work.
Where buttons are used the toolmaker sets them at the bench, but
the lathe hand can be instructed on the set-up and the use of the
warbler and indicator. The same method can be used on the milling
machine in boring holes for bushings, etc. If there is not enough
turning the same man can do the boring. The whole result is the
toolmaker can supervise, or carry through, a number of jobs at the
same time. The lathe hand saves time because he has his tools
ground, his straps, parallels, etc., ready at hand and he knows his
machine. It is the writer’s experience that more time is lost by the
toolmaker in hunting for these accessories than it frequently takes
to do the job.</p>

<p><em>The Shaper.</em> On the shaper the work can be divided into
roughing out and following an irregular line. Let us take a blanking
die for an example. The diemaker (who works at the bench) lays
out the die on rough stock. Then it is roughed out to this layout.
Next the tap-holes and swivel pins are drilled, tapped and reamed.
Now the diemaker can set his die up and lay it out more accurately
to his turnplate. The better shaper hand now machines the pieces
to his lines and all the diemaker has to do is file the clearance on
the cutting edge and remove tool marks. In a sectional die he frequently
leaves this for the grinder to do. Now the punch, which
has been roughed out, is “sheared” and the machine hand machines
the surplus stock from it to make it easier for the diemaker. The
head block, shoe, knockout plate, sub-press pins, and stripper have
been machined and are ready for him. The drill press hand does
the drilling and reaming for the pins and springs, also the tapping.
By this method of using the semi-skilled machine hands the skilled
man can carry on five and more dies at the same time and <em>not lose
any time waiting for machines</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Miller.</em> The milling machine work can be divided into flat
work, cutting teeth in cutters, reamers, gears, etc., spiral cutting,
boring jigs and special outline work.,</p>

<p>Take the first two groups. The semi-skilled operator can be
easily trained for this work, as it does not call for more difficult
work than the use of the dividing head, and there is always a chart
for that. Spiral cutting can be taught, as there is a chart for that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Cutting cams is more difficult but if there is enough of it the operators
can be taught to do it.</p>

<p>The boring of drill jigs, and similar work, can be done by an
operator because it is laid out beforehand by the toolmaker, or diemaker
in case it is a die.</p>

<p><em>The Drill Press.</em> The drill press work presents the same solution.
The skilled tool or diemaker makes the layout and then drills
the holes to the layout. Why use the skilled man’s time when a
lower-priced, and less valued, operator can be used to drill to this
same layout?</p>

<p><em>Grinders.</em> The horizontal, the plain (or flat) and the universal
grinding machines have always had specially trained men so we need
not consider them here.</p>

<p><em>Special Machines.</em> The remaining machines in the toolroom are
generally special machines with men to operate them. The toolmaker
uses, for the most part, only the machines considered in this
article.</p>

<p><em>Training.</em> The question now arises, “Where will these men be
trained and who will train them?” I offer this answer. Men on
these machines throughout the factory are semi-skilled in their use
and are mostly on repetition work. Take the best of them and
train them in the Training Department, or in the tool room, and
replace them by new men in the factory.</p>

<p><em>Results.</em> This method results in: First, enabling the skilled
tool or diemaker to handle more work than if he had to do all the
machine and layout work; second, increasing the output per machine,
for it stops the time lost through the machine’s being idle and the
tools being separated from the machine. In this matter alone it
presents a saving, as it calls for only one set of tools per machine,
against a set for every man in the room who keeps them in his
bench drawer most of the time; third, it eliminates the time lost by
the skilled man’s waiting around for a particular machine. He is
now able to plan one job after another and turn it over to the
machine operator and thus devote all his time to work that an
unskilled man cannot do.</p>

<h2>THE BLANCHARD MACHINE COMPANY</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">64 State Street, Cambridge, Mass.</p>

<p>As you know, we have been running our Training Department
for about five weeks only, hence we are not in position to give
you any definite information as to the value of it, etc., but from
what we can see it will be undoubtedly a great help to us, because
all the unskilled help go to the instructor before being put into the
shop. Those who have had some experience are put into the shop,
with the instructor to give them detailed information for as long a
time as is necessary, and to teach them the important parts of the
work in hand. This, as you can imagine, is more difficult in this
shop where we do not manufacture large quantities than it would
be in a shop where there was a uniform operation, such as there
would be on shells, and work of that kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>We have taken cabinetmakers and taught them to run boring
mills; blank book salesmen to assemble units for our SURFACE
GRINDERS; shoemakers to assemble units for SURFACE GRINDERS;
carpenters to run turret lathes, and plain helpers or sweepers
to break in on Surface and Floor Motor Grinders.</p>

<p>We also have a number of women in the shop whom we have
taken in without their having any previous experience in machine
work, and taught them various operations, such as broaching, bench
work, drilling, turning bevel gears, vise work, cutting long threads,
and work of a similar nature, and have found them very satisfactory
on this class of work.</p>

<p>We have endeavored to teach them the rudiments of this work
before putting them on to regular production work, but after they
master the first part of it, all the work that is done is on a regular
production basis, and we have found in a great many cases that they
have been able to reduce the time taken per piece to a very marked
degree over what has formerly been taken by men.</p>

<p>I send herewith eight photographs of our operatives that have
been broken into skilled work of various kinds throughout our shop,
that has previously been done by men skilled in the particular line
involved.</p>

<p>We think that some of these are almost remarkable, when we
consider what our attitude was two years ago on work of this kind,
refusing absolutely to put anyone on who had not been skilled in
the particular line involved.</p>

<h2>THE AMERICAN SHELL COMPANY</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Paterson, N. J.</p>

<p>In reference to our method of producing toolroom outfits most
economically and with a large output:</p>

<p>This is chiefly accomplished by anticipating our machine shop
requirements or demands far enough in advance so that the majority
of work passing through the toolroom can be manufactured in
quantities great enough to be produced economically, and also
bringing the toolroom work nearer to an actual manufacturing
basis. This also eliminates a lot of down or lost time, including the
unnecessary losses, such as occur between jobs on work of this nature.</p>

<p>It also decreases the percentage of losses due to spoiled work
as workers become more skilled in performing one kind of work
rather than a number of different classes of work, which is invariably
the case in toolrooms.</p>

<p>We also find this gives us the opportunity to take advantage of
present conditions and hire a man who sometimes is inclined to
call himself a toolmaker, although he is not an all-around man but
is still quite suitable under our conditions of working.</p>

<p>We find, too, that on quantity production in toolroom, we are in
a position to effect some very great savings in time and money, as
it permits standard jigs and fixtures, such as in ordinary manufacturing;
for instance, we at one time machined all our flat tool
bits made of high speed steel before hardening and grinding, while
our present method is to heat bars of steel in gas furnace and
then punch out with die under heavy hammer or press. This
method alone in a couple of hours gives us a supply ahead that
would ordinarily take one machine or more in continuous operation
to produce.</p>

<p>The classes of work in toolroom are also segregated as much
as possible; we have one gang for machine repair and reconstruction
only. Another gang does all the roughing work on tools and gauges
so that the finishing work only on gauges is done by the gauge-makers
who are also practically a separate gang. The grinding of
tools is under one skilled mechanic who is a working gang boss and
leader of men trained to do this work only.</p>

<p>Our tool supply is never permitted to get below the fixed
minimum quantity, and record of this condition is always before the
toolroom foreman and maintained by his clerk. His clerk is advised
hourly on this through the disbursements which he receives from
various shop cribs.</p>

<p>We also make a daily record of these same disbursements as
against operations and production, thereby keeping in close touch
with this situation, obviating any unnecessary tool wastage which
very quickly may become extremely expensive, and which also may
cause dangerous delays in production in shop due to shortages in
tool supply.</p>

<h2>WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC AND MANUFACTURING CO.</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">East Pittsburgh, Pa.</p>

<p>Until recently we have confined our training, as such, very
largely to trades apprentices. We have a four-year course for
these as mechanics, electricians and patternmakers.</p>

<p>Until recently it has been our plan to train new employees in
the section to which they were assigned, upon the machines and
work with which they were to be regularly connected. The various
shop departments have instructors picked from the best workmen
to demonstrate machines and their operation, when necessary.</p>

<p>What has already been said applies to both men and women,
and up to the present time we have done nothing more than this in
the way of training men employees.</p>

<p>Recently we have inaugurated a training course for women
machine operators and a department has been equipped wherein
these women are instructed in the operation of machine tools, such as
lathes, drill press, screw machines, grinders and milling machines.
This department is also to train women who are to work on mechanical
fitting.</p>

<p>In addition to this we have a training school for instructing
women employees in electrical work, such as winding, taping, soldering,
connecting and insulating.</p>

<p>These schools are primarily for beginners and it is the plan to
obtain women for these training sections through our centralized
Employment Department. Then, when any manufacturing department
wishes help, it will obtain it from the training section.</p>

<p>The instructor from these training sections is a high-grade man
assisted by women, and these instructors are carefully selected
from our own best employees.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The length of the training period runs from two to three days</span><br>
up to three to four weeks, depending upon the difficulty of the
occupation and the adaptability of the woman being trained.

<p>We have also recently inaugurated a training school for women
clerks and we have had for some time a training school for stenographers,
typists, tracers and dictaphone operators.</p>

<p>We believe that preliminary training is very desirable for both
men and women and that if equipment and space are allowable,
special training departments should be established wherever the
nature of the work will permit it.</p>

<h2>NORTON GRINDING COMPANY</h2>

<p>Below is a list of men from the Norton Co., Worcester, taking a
summer course in the Worcester Trade School to qualify in an eight
weeks’ course as all round machine hands. Five other factories are
sending similar groups of employees. Their wages will soon be from
30 per cent. to 100 per cent. more than ever before, which indicates
in a measure their increased service in the war emergency.</p>

<p>Could anything indicate better than this group in training for
all round machine hands, and the statement of their previous

<h2>DETROIT STEEL PRODUCTS CO.</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Detroit, Michigan</p>

<p>Some time ago it became necessary to increase the number of
skilled mechanics in the steel spring business and a company in
Detroit segregated a group of handymen under a skilled mechanic
to see if they could acquire the necessary skill in a period less than
three years which was then the admitted necessary time for complete
apprenticeship. The plan had the assistance of a man trained
in teaching methods but without large knowledge of the special
business in hand. After four weeks’ training an operator was
put on production work who equalled the average mechanic in this
line of work and who in three months was leading the production
of the shop. This initial success led to the establishment of schooling
as the proper method of securing skilled help in this factory.</p>

<p>The elements most desirable in industrial training are:</p>

<p>1. Separation of the training department from production so
as to avoid interference with production and also interference with
the operators in training.</p>

<p>2. Supplying a full knowledge of the special business or trade
through an instructor fully trained.</p>

<p>3. Supplying a full knowledge of teaching methods through
an instructor who can act as a vehicle for the transfer of trade
information in simple language to the new operators.</p>

<p>4. Application of the students’ time to learning one simple
operation, preferably on a subdivided operation.</p>

<p>5. Application of the student’s time to learning the free operation
of the tool together with opportunity to try its operation on
some personally chosen work.</p>

<p>6. Satisfactory high scale of wage, but one which can be
exceeded in actual production.</p>

<p>7. Encouragement to the operators and then more encouragement.</p>

<p>8. Selection of suitable operators.</p>

<p>Of all these the ones most overlooked are numbers 1, 3 and 6.</p>

<p>Many managers think that good instruction can be given right
in the producing departments, whereas this has been proven to be a
great interference with both production and schooling.</p>

<p>Most attempts to use skilled mechanics as instructors has failed
because they lacked the ability to properly convey to others the
knowledge they possessed. The assistance of a trained teacher has
made the work of many mechanical instructors a real success.</p>

<p>The opinion that the company is doing a disinterested thing in
training new operators has led some to believe that the wage scale
for learners could be made very low. One way to help a man to
act like a gentleman is to dress him as such and treat him as far
as possible as such. The same holds true with operators in training.
The fact that they are rated well and trained by the best of
mechanics, on the best of tools, in a shop with good surroundings,
means much in the final success of industrial training.</p>

<h2>SCOVILL MANUFACTURING CO.</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Waterbury, Conn.</p>

<p>The training room of the Scovill Manufacturing Company
started April 1, 1918.</p>

<p>We train beginners on hand screw machines and engine lathes on
plain turning. The training for experienced workers is to teach
toolsetters with some experience to be experts along special lines
and otherwise developed in their work. Also workmen with some
general experience in machine room work are taught to run engine
lathes. Further developments in general machine room work is to
be taken up later.</p>

<p>Our best instructors are picked from those engaged in actual
production or from promising pupils in the training school.</p>

<p>Skill, patience and teaching ability are the requirements of
the teachers.</p>

<p>The best trainees are those recruited from other lines of work
in the factory, especially at this time, and those impelled with the
real sense of duty. Requirements: Average strength, intelligence
and a desire to learn.</p>

<p>The steady type is preferable to the more brilliant operator
who lacks staying qualities. The operators are trained in the class
of work they are expected to follow, and this training is valued in
proportion as it increases production from the first in the production
rooms, and enables the operator to face actual working conditions
without hesitancy and without fear of handling the machines.</p>

<p>The total cost of installation for our school to date has been
approximately $2,000. With us, the cost of training (being the
amount paid operatives above their earnings while in the training
room) is approximately as follows:</p>

<p>Engine lathe workers $34 average.</p>

<p>Toolsetters $25 average.</p>

<p>Female screw machine operators $10 average.</p>

<p>The average number of female operators in the school is nine
and their average length of time for training is eight days.</p>

<p>The male operators, both engine lathe workers and toolsetters,
require from three to six weeks’ training before they are sent out
to the production rooms.</p>

<p>For tool room purposes we have not taken up the training of
women and have only taken up the training of men along the lines
of simple punch turning and straight work. We find that the men
we instruct in this line of work are very interested and stick closer
to the job than the average apprentice in the tool room.</p>

<h2>THE RECORDING &amp; COMPUTING MACHINES CO.</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Dayton, Ohio</p>

<p>Several years ago we had over 200 toolmakers in our tool room
engaged upon high grade jigs, fixtures, gauges, etc. The demand for
toolmakers became such that the men were leaving us and it became
practically impossible to get an adequate supply of this highly
skilled labor.</p>

<p>My engineers, superintendents and myself made a study of the
proposition and found that on the work that the tool room was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
doing it was unnecessary to employ such highly skilled labor on
70 per cent. of the work on the average. We, therefore, differentiated
the work into its component elements and made a careful line of
cleavage between the highly skilled work which the toolmakers were
doing and the work which could be done by ordinary machinists.
We then brought in men who were machinists, separating them into
several necessary grades. We had sufficient work of a minor character
to keep the lower grades busy practically all the time. We,
therefore, taught them just how we wanted the work done.</p>

<p>As a result of this differentiation of the elements going to make
up tool room work and the shaping of a distinct line of cleavage
between the work requiring high skill and that requiring skill of a
lesser grade, we were able to reduce our toolmaking force to less
than fifty.</p>

<p>I am sure that a close study of the work done in any tool
room and a division of the work same as along the lines indicated
above will result in a decrease of the number of toolmakers required.</p>

<h2>OHMER FARE REGISTER COMPANY</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Dayton, Ohio</p>

<p>The training department occupies a space of 25x60 feet and has
the following equipment installed as a beginning:</p>

<p class="no-indent">
1 13-inch lathe.<br>
1 20-inch lathe.<br>
1 36-inch lathe.<br>
1 No. 5 Cincinnati Milling Machine.<br>
1 No. 24 Osterlein Milling Machine.<br>
1 No. 5 Brown &amp; Sharpe Vertical Milling Machine.<br>
1 24-inch Shaper.<br>
1 Bathe Universal Grinder.<br>
1 4-foot Cincinnati Bickford Radial Drill.<br>
1 20-inch Barnes Drill.<br>
1 Brown &amp; Sharpe Hand Screw Machine.<br>
1 14-inch Wet Tool Grinder.<br>
About 30 feet of benches with vises, etc.<br>
</p>

<p>At one end of the space they have an office and class room,
15x20 feet. In it they have chairs, blackboard, drawing board, etc.
It is their practice to assemble all of the students in the class room
for a few minutes each day and give them short talks about the
work and the fundamentals of the business. These talks are made
as pithy as possible and only one main fact is presented at a time.</p>

<p>They are taking in green help, either from the laborers in the
shop or hired from outside, both men and women, and are training
them for machine operators and bench hands. Their conditions
are such that they cannot do as many concerns do, train for a
single operation, as they must make all-around operators.</p>

<p>Their method is such that if the foreman of the lathe department
is in need of a man he makes out a “request for help” form
and has it sent to the school where his needs are supplied if possible;
the “request for help” is then sent to the Employment Agent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
stating that the request has been filled and the Employment Agent
fills the vacancy in the school.</p>

<p>In teaching the names of parts of the various machines, they
are going to give each student a picture of the particular machine
he is to work on; these pictures are numbered and on a separate
sheet are the names of the corresponding parts. This is done so that
they can be examined in the names of parts and not have the name
in front of them to refer to.</p>

<p>Only regular factory production which must pass inspection is
used for instruction.</p>

<p>In regard to instructors, they have taken a man from the tool
room who is a mechanic and a good teacher. He can handle any
and all of the machines and has the ability to tell what he knows
in a clear way that is readily understood.</p>

<p>Most of the students in the training room at present have been
hired from outside but as it is becoming better known among the
men, the laborers are applying for admission in rapidly increasing
numbers. They have several traveling salesmen, office men and a
few who have taken their degree. These latter are not very satisfactory,
however—they are not nearly so amenable to instruction as
are men who have been brought up to work.</p>

<p>Their training period will probably extend from four or five
days to as many weeks, depending on the adaptability of the student
and the difficulty of the machine for which they are being
trained.</p>

<p>Women have not yet been introduced on the heavier machines
but it is intended to do so within the near future.</p>

<h2>BURROUGHS ADDING MACHINE COMPANY</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Detroit, Mich.</p>

<p>The Burroughs Adding Machine Company established in 1907
an apprentice school (course four years) which from its inception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
has proved an unqualified success. Our apprentices have also
attended classes in the Cass Technical High School in Detroit. In
the year 1916 we instituted a course along similar lines to our
apprentice course for our service men.</p>

<p>However, the general shortage of skilled male help, the loss of
over 800 men through the draft, and the rapid expansion of our
business has obliged us to supplement our force with a considerable
amount of female help in order that the increased demand for our
labor-saving product be met.</p>

<p>Early in the present year, therefore, we established a school
for unskilled female labor in connection with one of our departments
engaged in the simpler operations. As the young women
pass through the Employment Department they are placed in this
Training School under the supervision of a competent instructor
and are thoroughly grounded in the operation performed in that
particular department. While in this school their characteristics
are studied and as they acquire proficiency and their ability
develops, they are assigned to more intricate and important work
in the other departments throughout the factory. The selection
for these assignments is determined by their physical condition and
their mechanical development and aptitude. The instructor explains
thoroughly the nature of the new employment, points out the advantages
accruing to the employees because of their increased
earning capacities; introduces them into the new department, points
out in detail the various operations conducted therein, and painstakingly
explains the scope of their new duties.</p>

<p>The following day they are started at their new operation, and
by frequent observation, instruction and encouragements improve
to a degree where they become expert in the one operation.</p>

<p>In this manner girls are gradually developed from the simpler
burring and filing operations until we now employ them in departments
performing such varied operations as indicated below.</p>

<p>Spring-winding, riveting machines, drill-press and milling machines,
straightening of parts, assembling of special features, assembling
and fitting type, the erection of machines, adjusting and
inspecting machines, assembling and adjusting motors, punch press
and hand and automatic screw machine work.</p>

<p>As the girls graduate from the starting department, or school,
they don the regular shop uniform, consisting of a suit of overalls,
and take their place alongside the men and under the same general
conditions as to hours of labor and rates of pay. This stepping-up
method of training the unskilled females has been a success with
us as far as it goes, and <em>has enabled us to increase our production
50 per cent. for the current year in spite of the acute skilled labor
situation</em>.</p>

<p>From April 1, when the training school was established, up to
the present time, 412 young women have been received in Department
35, and 260 have been trained and transferred to other
departments. At all times there are about forty or fifty young
women undergoing training. Only nine young women have been
returned to Department 35 for further training since April 1. After
receiving additional training these nine were again placed and in
no case has one failed for the second time. It is just a matter of
finding the right place for the right young women, and then there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
is no question about them making good on the jobs, as they are
proving every day.</p>

<p>In conclusion, tribute must be paid to the 1,200 women in
our factory whose earnest desire to help their country in its time
of need, and whose mentality and courage have enabled them to
make a success of a kind of employment entirely foreign to them
on the general conception of their abilities.</p>

<p>The Underwood Typewriter Co., Hartford, Conn., has undertaken

permit them to attend to their household cares to a reasonable

small children between two and one-half and nine years of age,
having given over a space in their plant for the care of such children

They have found many who are willing to engage with them under
this plan, and are pleased to report the whole general scheme is
working out well. Many of the women of either class have become
expert in skilled work with but a limited time for training. Under
their method, however, the instructing is done in each of the manufacturing
departments where the plan has been introduced, as they
have operated under good regulations as to quality and quantity
for many years back, rendering it very practicable in their case to
not instruct and train in separate spaces, although they appreciate
the need for acting otherwise with new work, such as has been
brought about by the war, and wherein the tasks at hand are not
subject to accurate measurement to start with.</p>

<h2>THE NATIONAL CASH REGISTER COMPANY</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Dayton, Ohio</p>

<p>The Training School for women, of whom over eight hundred
have been placed in the various departments, was started in the
latter part of March, 1918.</p>

<p>Because of the demand for trained help in the factory, we have
not been able to keep them in the Training School as long as we
would wish, but even this short experience has been sufficient to take
away the fear of the shop, as many of our women have never had
any factory experience before.</p>

<p>While in the Training School the students are paid the regular
starting rate for women, and after they enter the factory and become
more efficient their rate increases until they can do the work that a
man previously did both as regards quality and quantity and they
receive a man’s wage.</p>

<p>In some departments it has been found necessary to put slightly
more women on the same operations than men formerly employed
to obtain the same production, but as the women gain experience,
their production increases rapidly and the quality is as good, if not
better. The women have proven themselves very apt in picking up
the smaller class of assembling on account of their nimble fingers
and care in handling stock.</p>

<p>We use our regular production to train the students, and as it
must pass 100 per cent. inspection, we emphasize quality and not
quantity.</p>

<p>We find the best class of workers comes from those between
twenty-one and forty years of age, with, of course, exceptions.</p>

<p>We not only teach the new employees the mechanical operations,
but also give them “Health and Safety” lectures, and show them
pictures of many ways one can become injured if they do not use
precaution while working around machinery. They are also instructed
in the use of time and instruction tickets.</p>

<p>Our Inspectors are selected from the factory, preference being
given to those who are experts on their particular class of work.</p>

<p>It is our opinion that the Training School is the proper way to
teach the inexperienced help in order that they may learn the work
quickly and get on a production basis in a short time instead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
hiring and placing help right in the shop and letting them pick it up
with what assistance and instruction they can from their fellow
workmen.</p>

<p>In the Training School the most efficient workers can be reorganized
in a short time, and the less efficient ones can be given
special attention, and usually <em>we can bring them to a degree of
efficiency not possible under the old method</em>.</p>

<p>We try to find out in the training school where the student’s
strong point is, whether on machine operation or bench work, and
are enabled in this way to place them in a job they are particularly
suited for, thus keeping the problem out of the factory. If they
show a proper degree of interest, they are given all possible encouragement.</p>

<p>We have had to materially increase the size of our school, and
with the hearty co-operation we are receiving from the heads of the
different departments, we believe the employment of women on our
work is proving a success in every way.</p>

<p>Another point that we think is good is that the school itself is
nearly self-sustaining.</p>

<p>The accompanying photo, number one, will give an idea of the
size of our school, and also the various classes of work we train
them on.</p>

<p>Number two shows a gang of hand mills “manned” by women.
These girls have all been through our Training School and are now
working on a piece basis and doing it successfully.</p>

<h2>PACKARD MOTOR CAR COMPANY</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Detroit, Mich.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1914 labor conditions were somewhat disturbed
in Detroit. We lost a good many of our expert varnish
rubbers, and we could not get skilled men to replace them, and we
tried to break in men on the varnish rubbing deck, but found that
too much work was spoiled by the green men, and the experienced
men did not have time or inclination to properly instruct those who
were unskilled. This led to the establishment of a school for training
varnish rubbers and was the beginning of our efforts to train
unskilled workers. The result of this experience was so highly successful
that we carried it to all of the other branches of body manufacture,
and <em>a school for training unskilled help became a permanent
part of our institution</em>.</p>

<p>We were able to teach women how to trim automobile bodies,
and they learned in an average of less than ninety days. Their
work was of a very high order, and we were very much gratified
with what they accomplished. Very often we found that we were
able to train men to an exceedingly high degree of skill in less
than sixty days. All men were not so apt. Some of them could
not be placed in the skilled class even after three months of training.</p>

<p>As the war activities took workers we turned our school into
training quarters for mechanics. For instructors we aim to use the
best workers in a particular class that we have, providing that they
have the natural ability to instruct others. Some men lack the
ability to impart their knowledge to others. This type of man does
not make a good instructor. A man should not only be an expert in
his trade, but he should have the natural ability to impart his knowledge
in order to become a good instructor.</p>

<p>In teaching some of the women we find that some women pick
up very quickly some particular trade and when they become
experts we in turn make them instructors. We have not yet developed
any toolmakers. We have developed men to tool room work,
such as turning, grinding, etc., but this is not really toolmaking.</p>

<p>We believe that it is possible to turn out good toolmakers and
we are turning our energies to this end.</p>

<h2>NORTH AMERICAN MOTORS CO.</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Pottstown, Pa.</p>

<p>Our production is about half of what it should be, due to lack
of skilled help, in other words, due to lack of machinists. We have
not had much trouble in getting green men and we have had no
trouble in training these green men to do the operations on the
shell both accurately and quickly, but we have had trouble in <em>getting
men to maintain the tools or to equip for these operators</em>.</p>

<p>Facing this condition and being unable to obtain machinists, we
decided to train men to do machinists’ and toolmakers’ work.</p>

<p>Our scheme as outlined is as follows: We are taking operators
who have had experience of a year or more in our shop and are
putting them <em>into the school</em> under a good mechanic who fortunately
is a teacher also. After a few weeks in the school we are <em>putting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
them into the tool room as operators</em>, that is, they will be on work
where they will get work <em>of a repeating nature</em> and they will stay on
the same class of work for a considerable period of time, depending
on the man and how fast our other pupils come on, the idea being
then to take the first man back again to the school and teach him to
operate some other machine tool, then send him back in the tool
room, where, after he has operated on the second type of tool for a
certain length of time, he would then be of more use, as the tool
room foreman could then place him on either one of two machines.
For the more attentive and interested men we would continue this
scheme and thus teach them the operations of all machines and tools
used in the tool room. We have also provided for a certain line of
bench training.</p>

<p>Within the next few weeks we hope to be able to take some of
our machine tools from the shell shop and put them into this school
and we will then train our operators in this school with the idea in
mind, as stated in our previous letter, of teaching them the proper
care of a machine tool, as we consider this of vital importance. In
fact, the writer would say that from observation in other plants and
experience here that it is his opinion that one of the greatest, if not
the greatest, causes for lack of production in machine shops now on
shell work is due to <em>machine breakage</em>, this coming from several
causes, among the foremost being the lack of knowledge on the
operators’ part.</p>

<p>When the idea of the school was first brought up there was
some feeling among the skilled mechanics that the men trained in
the school would replace them to the detriment of the mechanic, but
this idea has passed or is passing away very rapidly and we find a
considerable interest shown by the mechanics in the things that we
are teaching. Two of our good machinists who are on maintenance
or repair work have asked to be allowed to go to the school so that
they may become better workers and get a training on finer work.
Others have shown similar interest and we have tentatively agreed
to start an evening school this fall for mechanics, our proposal being
to work in conjunction with the Y. M. C. A. for shop drawing and
the reading of drawings and to use our own shop for special instruction
on machine tools.</p>

<p>We are enclosing herewith three photographs showing work
in our vestibule school for women on gauge finishing work. The
picture of the six women in a line with the instructor at the end
shows the pupils on gauge finishing work, lapping plug, thread
gauges, snap gauges, etc. These women have proven themselves
very apt, but difficulty is being experienced, due to the fact that
the necessary laps requiring highly skilled mechanics are often
made defective, on account of the feeling of the skilled tool and
gauge makers who do not wish any of the women to do any of
this work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>The women show a better spirit and give a much better production,
at least three times as much as the men do on the same
work. The one photograph showing the six women in a row and
the instructor at the far end, shows a group in the school lapping
these gauges.</p>

<h2>OAKLEY MACHINE TOOL COMPANY</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Cincinnati, Ohio</p>

<p>Our shop has an average of 75 men on its pay roll, making a
Precision Tool Room Grinder. Before the United States joined the
forces of Liberty we had felt a shortage of labor and had taken
steps to break in untrained men.</p>

<p>Thinking we were not large enough to inaugurate a Vestibule
Training Room, as it is generally understood, we inaugurated a
system of training men directly in our shop.</p>

<p>We sorted out applicants and put them in our shop, two at a
time; if they had never worked in a shop before we started them
on simple machines, such as the hack saw, centering machine, etc.,
in order that they might get used to the noise and methods of the
machine shop. They were then advanced to Roughing Lathes, being
given simple jobs, such as turning and facing.</p>

<p>By having only two at a time the foreman was able to give
them personal supervision, without interfering with his regular work.
As they developed they were given more difficult jobs. We found,
as a rule, inside of sixty days such men made very fair machine
hands.</p>

<p>We also broke men in on drill presses and shapers, using same
tactics and had very successful results. To give you an idea as to
the class of men from which we have made machine operators, we
have working in our shop to-day one bartender, piano tuner, street
car conductor, bricklayer, coal miner and an artist—self made. The
other unskilled men had had some previous experience on productive
labor, either running punching presses, nailing machines, or work
requiring a smattering of mechanical ability.</p>

<p>Our experience is that if you take a man over 30 that has
become disgusted from a blind alley profession, where there is no
hope of advancement, point out the possibilities of the machine tool
trade, and give him a living wage to start, even though at first he
is not worth it, he develops into a good and loyal man. They are,
however, like children, they have to be encouraged every so often
by a personal talk or suggestions from the head man.</p>

<p>Of course we have had our failures, but our successes have been
in the majority, so we are continuing to break in green help.</p>

<h2>LINCOLN MOTOR COMPANY</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Detroit, Mich.</p>

<p>Our school is going along nicely and while we are not perfecting
machine tool operators to the degree I would like because of
the necessity of rushing them through the school to the shop proper,
we are accomplishing, I think, that which we set out to do, namely,
to take away from the girl the fear of the shop and to give her a
fair knowledge of the tool she is to handle. The women undoubtedly
have benefited beyond measure by the short time spent in the
school room, and have gone into the factory with the confidence
that carried them through the first few days and made them
efficiently productive in a shorter period of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>The training room is located in the smaller of our two plants
and is equipped with a lathe, milling machine, gear cutter, drill
press, profiler, etc., those being the tools upon which it was decided
to train operators. In charge of this room was placed an instructor
who had had some slight experience in a continuation school and
<em>who went to work under the direct supervision of a high grade
specialist secured from a well known eastern factory efficiency organization</em>.
The instructor was given no special instruction beyond
being told what we hoped to accomplish in the way of building up
an organization of women of more than ordinary ability and moral
character.</p>

<p>The training room up to the present time has been used only in
connection with supplying the factory with women workers. Women
of the age of twenty-one and upwards have been taken, their references
carefully examined, and they have been given <em>from one to
three days’ training in this school</em>. Because of the demand of the
shop for help it has not always been possible to keep them in a
training room for as long a period as would seem desirable, and in
some instances they have stayed only one day.</p>

<p>During the training period they have been paid the regular
rate for women, thirty cents per hour, which rate maintains after
they enter the shop until such time as they are placed upon a
piece-work basis.</p>

<p>We believe, however, that through the medium of the training
room we shall be able to instruct women workers in machine tool
operation so they will go direct from the school room into the shop
without fear of what is to be encountered therein, and with a better
knowledge of the tool they are operating, and the reason they are
operating it, than they could possibly acquire through any other
method.</p>

<p>The school is favorably looked upon by all of the employees,
and in those cases where it is found that a woman is not working

is returned to it for further instruction, she has in all cases gone
back to it with a cheerfulness and willingness that is both surprising
and gratifying.</p>

<p>The writer is of the opinion that the school in this factory has
come to stay and that when we build up our organization and get
through the strenuous times we are now experiencing, the advantage
of the vestibule school instruction will be given men employees as
well as women.</p>

<h2>TRAINING FOR THE TOOL ROOM</h2>

<p>You mention training in the more difficult lines of effort, such
as Tool Room, Machine Shops, etc. We agree with you as to the
wide possibilities in this field, and are now organizing to accomplish
this very thing at the Lincoln Motor Company.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war when labor shortage was seriously
manifested, I had charge of the reconstruction of a tool
room, employing 270 toolmakers and machinists, engaged in the
making of cutters, reamers, broaches, drill jigs, milling fixtures, etc.</p>

<p>Realizing then the difficulty that the future held in store of
securing competent, reliable toolmakers and machinists, we undertook
to train men who had no previous experience in this line. Our
results were quite gratifying. We classified all work and trained
men to operate specific machines against the various classifications.</p>

<p>To illustrate: We engaged a carpenter 67 years of age, who
had no previous machine shop experience, trained him to run a
Universal Milling Machine; not only did he meet successfully all
work scheduled against his machine, but developed such skill in the
operation of this machine, that later he compared favorably with
the average good toolmaker, and in six months’ time we depended
on him entirely to set up his own machine and proceed as a regular
toolmaker. This represents intensive training and what was accomplished
here can be accomplished in other general lines of tool room
work.</p>

<p>We ultimately had 215 of these trained operators who were
able to carry on the work, supported by 55 good toolmakers. I am
with you in the confidence that it will be necessary to plan quite
considerably in the adoption of some means to overcome a situation
which looks really serious for the future.</p>

are able to do the light operations on turret lathes quite satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Our greatest difficulty is in our Toolmaking Department, but we

<p>We are selecting a good lathe hand from among our toolmakers
and giving him from one to three students, paying him from 20
per cent. to 30 per cent., depending on the number of students he
is able to take care of successfully, and we then pay these students
about 50 per cent. of what the instructor receives with stipulated
raises in pay until they have served two years, at the end of which
time we pay them a very liberal bonus.</p>

<p>We have been able to secure some young men just out of

<h2>CINCINNATI MILLING MACHINE CO.</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Cincinnati, Ohio</p>

<p>We put the new employee into a department and assign him or
her to a machine in charge of a skilled operator. The new employee
becomes at once an observer and a helper, and in a little while takes
charge of the machine and the skilled operator stands by and gives
special instructions.</p>

<p>We have detail instruction cards or process sheets for all operations,
and one of these cards in the hands of the new operator will
serve as a guide for turning out the work properly after the
instructor leaves the new employee to himself or herself.</p>

<p>In addition to this we have certain selected engineers from the
Time Study Department, who are attached to both the day and
night shifts, and devote their entire time to coaching the new operators,
and see to it that they learn to acquire the desired degree of
skill and proficiency.</p>

<p>We find that the women who are selected for this sort of work
just about equal the men. They show considerable enthusiasm for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
the work, as is indicated by a less degree of lateness and absenteeism
than that of the men, but we have not had enough experience as yet
to say anything definite in this regard.</p>

<p>It is also perhaps true that we are taking greater pains instructing
the women than we would in the ordinary course take in instructing
green men.</p>

<h2>THE STANDARD PARTS CO.</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Cleveland, Ohio</p>

<p>Each individual department at the start of the year had its
own training division, that is, while we had the orders we lacked
a good many of the machines necessary to do our work and the
proper tool equipment to start with. We also required the services
of eight hundred additional people.</p>

<p>We trained absolutely unskilled men and women during this
slack period, so that when we started in quantity production we had
also obtained speed. An item that might be of interest to you is
the fact that we are now employing women in Drill Presses, Milling
Machines, Hand and Automatic Screw Machines, Turret Lathes,
Speed Lathes, Engine Lathes, Assembly Work and Inspection Work.</p>

</figure>

<p>These women and the majority of the unskilled men whom we
employed are doing work in most cases where dimensions are held
to one-half thousandth of an inch limit variation. In a plant employing
excess of five thousand people am absolutely convinced that
a separate vestibule training school is a necessity, and in plants
already producing work in large quantities there is liable to be a
heavy demand for trained skilled workers, a separate training school
would be necessary.</p>

<p>However, where the number of workers needed do not exceed
ten people on an individual operation training on machines in the
department would be sufficient.</p>

<h2>THE YALE &amp; TOWNE MFG. CO.</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Stamford, Conn.</p>

<p>We have had in operation for over a year a vestibule school
for the training of women employees in our plant, and are obtaining
good results from it.</p>

<p>We are training the women mostly for bench and machine
work which was formerly done by men, such as: Lock assembling;
drill press work, which was formerly considered inappropriate for
women employees; hand screw machine and automatic screw
machine operators.</p>

<p>We are also training female help on lathe and shaper work.
We plan to do the same thing on milling machines and expect
eventually to include tool room work.</p>

<p>Our vestibule school activities include the training of male
foundry workers, and the training both of men and women to
become instructors and machine adjusters.</p>

<p>We also have an Apprenticeship School.</p>

<h2>ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS</h2>

<p class="center no-indent">154 E. Erie Street, Chicago</p>

<p>We are planning to have this school in operation within the
next month. The writer expects to be responsible for the results.
We expect to take one good man from our own plant as an instructor,
and we are also in communication with an instructor from a
college in a Western State whom we may have in direct charge of
this work should he prove to be the proper person.</p>

<p>At the present time we have in our factory about 75 female
employees, on Lathes, Milling Machines, Grinders, Finishing Gauges,
Lapping, etc., also inspectors, timekeepers and stock chasers.</p>

<p>Since your last visit we have employed a trained nurse who
is in charge of the employment and welfare work of all women
employed in the factory. This we have found has given us much
better results and can truthfully say that with very few exceptions,
every girl employed is certainly making good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>We have one instance where a man employed in the screw
machine department, employed in that capacity for about a year,
was having trouble in not producing on his machine. We had him
exchange machines with a woman who had had a month’s experience
and found that she practically doubled his output the first
day.</p>

<p>When you came to Rochester we were very much impressed
with the suggestions you made as to the introduction of women
into industry. We sent two representatives together with others
from Rochester to Dayton, as you advised, to investigate the conditions
there and also in Cincinnati. The excellent arrangements
made by the Cincinnati manufacturers to relieve the shortage of
labor by placing women at work in machine shops and elsewhere
were extremely interesting.</p>

<p>After learning what had been done we started using women
in our machine shop in line with your idea and the results have
been very satisfactory. * * * It is not a question of economy
with us but of releasing men for other work in the foundry which
women cannot perform. We believe that an intensive training of
two weeks would enable women to turn out practically as much
work as men are now doing.</p>

<h2>INTERESTING PARAGRAPHS</h2>

<p>Says Mr. E. G. Allen, the able Director of the Cass Technical Trade
School, Detroit: “We have taken high grade machinists in Detroit who have
been in the shops for a couple of years and were familiar with the use of
drawings, decimal equivalents, etc., and made tool room machine operators
doing work of considerable variety, each on a single type machine, almost
immediately. In three or four months, by continuing to watch and instruct such
a man, he has been able to run almost any machine and do on it almost any
work laid out by the toolmaker.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This war is going to last years. Even three or four months, which seems
a long time, will pass like a day. Are some of us not almost grossly careless
in not getting at this immediately? Mr. J. J. Pierson, Dilution Officer of the
British Ministry of Munitions in the London District, says: “You can make
a toolroom operator of a woman in three weeks. If you can’t do it in three
weeks, you can’t do it at all. You have simply gotten the wrong woman. Pick
out a long fingered, sensitive, intelligent woman from the shop force who has
been carefully trained and is especially satisfactory and exact in her production
and upgrade her in this way.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“This office has made an exhaustive study of the vestibule training methods
and results of the Section on Industrial Training, of the Council of National

to meet the increased war program and cannot be too quickly or extensively
adopted and should have the immediate and fullest support of all who are
charged with production matters. The shortage of skilled labor to-day is alone
two hundred and fifty thousand and we are advised will be one million by
January 1. This office is putting it into force and effect just as promptly and

<h2>EXTRACT PROM A REPORT BY MR. BEN H. MORGAN,
EXPERT ADVISER TO THE DILUTION SECTION OF
THE BRITISH MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS</h2>

<p>When war broke out in August, 1914, the Government of the
day urged employers to induce their skilled as well as unskilled
men to join the colors. No good purpose will be served in my
characterizing in suitable terms the unwisdom of such a step. Sufficient
to say that it was a long time later before the Government
realized that this was an Engineers’ war. The result was that the
men with initiative, education and skill were among the first to
lay aside their tools and join the colors. This was a stroke of
such folly that it took the country quite a long time to recover
from it. Not only had we lost men of brain and initiative but also
a large proportion of the skill for carrying on a war in which
machinery and munitions were a preponderating factor.</p>

<p>When the sudden call came for an enormous increase in guns
and ammunition the folly of the step that had been taken was realized
and arrangements were made to effect the return of a number
of skilled men from the colors. This, however, was difficult to
carry out, and on top of it came the realization that if every skilled
man were returned we had not sufficient to produce the munitions
essential to success.</p>

<p>It was in these circumstances that the present Prime Minister,
Mr. Lloyd George, then Minister of Munitions, laid down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
principle that no man must perform any work that could be efficiently
performed by women. He foresaw that every man would
be required for essentially man’s work. This involved the process
which has become known as the Dilution of Labor. This dilution
implies that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">(1) The employment of skilled men should be confined to work
which cannot be efficiently performed by less skilled labor
or by women.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">(2) Semi-skilled and unskilled men should be employed on any
work which does not necessitate the employment of skilled
men and for which women are unsuitable.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">(3) Women should be employed as far as practicable on all
classes of work for which they are suitable.</p>
</div>

<p>This, at first sight, seems a simple arrangement, but I need not
tell you that it is a complicated one and involves expenditure of
time, patience and money on the part of the employers and sympathetic
co-operation on the part of the skilled employees. Women
have to receive careful training, intervening hands in the processes
of production have to be upgraded and the skill in the factory has
to be spread over a large area, usually necessitating more supervision
and care if equal results are to be obtained. These are
average conditions, but in a large number of cases the changes due
to the introduction of women have resulted in considerably increased
outputs over men’s records, and this not only on light repetition
work, but on heavy turning and laboring work and skilled and
semi-skilled non-repetition work.</p>

<p>The patriotism shown by the employers in meeting the numerous
difficulties which confronted them in training women for every conceivable
kind of work, in reorganizing their factories for new productions
by new labor, adapting their machinery to the measure of
skill and strength available to work them has been one of the most
inspiriting experiences of the war. Women have been trained in an
incredibly short time, handling appliances of all kinds have been
installed, special tools and gauges have had to be made and often
when a work has been set fairly going and was reaching full production,
a change in the country’s needs for munitions compelled
the Ministry to alter a design or a size or to put a firm on to a
completely new product, and again the whole process of retaining
employees and adapting tools and plant had to be gone through.</p>

<p>If the employer has done well for the country, so, on the other
hand, no finer example of patriotism has been shown by any class
than by the artisan as a whole. On an appeal being made to the
Trades Unions soon after the outbreak of the war these Unions
without a single exception agreed to do what the national interests
required. A network of Trades Union rules and regulations,
usages and customs, the result of many years of activity by organized
labor, were freely set aside to allow for the introduction of women
in nearly every class of work, subject to reasonable conditions.</p>

<p>Whatever some employers may think this was a gigantic sacrifice
to make. It involved wages, hours, overtime, night work,
Sunday work, meal times, holidays, shop regulations and demarcation
arrangements, restriction of output, preparations of apprentices
and classes of employees to be engaged, etc., etc. This structure
of Trade Unionism the workingman agreed should be swept away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
to allow of the production of the maximum amount of munitions
by the readiest methods and by any character of labor that was
available—male or female—on the condition that the structure
should be replaced at the close of the war.</p>

<p>This is splendid patriotism and when you add to the sacrifice
of Trades Union Rules the burden, such as has fallen principally
on the Trades Union men, of training the hundreds of thousands of
women to do their work, this must increase our debt of appreciation
and gratitude. It is only by the loyal co-operation of employer and
employed that we are in the satisfactory position as regards munitions
that we are to-day.</p>

<p>By the process of dilution we have been able to place in munition
works about 950,000 women to do work from the heaviest
laboring unskilled operation to the highest grade of toolroom non-repetition
work. I do not hesitate to say that women have entirely
destroyed our pre-war ideas as to what constitutes “skilled” work.
When in the early days of the war women were trained to turn
out 18 pdr. H. E. shell and equal the production of male labor many
thought that such work, amounting as it does to little more than
manipulative dexterity, was about the limit of the capacity of
women who had not received a regular course of Engineering training.
After a few months’ workshop experience, however, women are
to-day building the greater part of one of the best High-Speed
Engines in the country, each woman setting her own tools and
work, and able to machine any piece of work that the tool she is
on will take. Women are building guns, including the fine fitting
work on the breech mechanism, and the cutting of large screw
threads up to a shoulder. They are doing most of the work in
some shops on three and one-half ton Army Lorries and will do
practically the whole of it if the war lasts much longer, including
chassis erection and testing. They are doing important work in
marine engine building, turning connecting rods, propeller shaft
liners and doing practically all in some cases of the marked-off
drilling. The Aero Engine, as you well know, is a very fine piece of
mechanism and at the outset was considered a tool room job throughout.
In some shops women are to-day doing the greater part of the
work turning on Centre Lathes to half a thousandth, milling webs
of Clerget Cylinders on a booker Miller without stops and setting
up their own jobs and working again to half a thousandth limit,
boring cylinders on a No. 9 Herbert and similar work on a Gishlet,
setting up their own jobs, turning and finishing test pieces in various
metals to a 5,000th; making tools and gauges of all kinds to fine
limits; all varieties of bench fitting to drawings and marking-off
work of every description. Locomotive work, steel constructional
work, boilers, bending, drilling and riveting. Women are doing
magnificent work both in regard to accuracy and output.</p>

<p>On shells of all nature women should, of course, be principally
employed. Contracts for shell will only be renewed and continued
after March 31st next (1917) with those firms who employ 80
per cent. of female labor on shell of sizes from 2.75” to 4.5” inclusive.
On larger sizes of shell, contracts will only be renewed if the Ministry
of Munitions’ instructions in regard to dilution have been carried
out, not only in regard to the proportion of women to be employed
in each factory but the proportions of semi-skilled men.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
